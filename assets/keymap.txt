# Lines starting with # are ignored, this file defines what keys are what, plain text as it is a relatively small/fast loading file each of the keys we want in the program must be associated with its SDL keycode, this is constant on all systems, see https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDLKeycodeLookup
#Note ctrl and shift are NOT customizable, as in that case we read the "modified state" this allows the program to be blind to whether left or right shift is used, or cabs lock is on (You can still map other actions to LSHIFT RSHIFT LCTRL etc.)
#Literal characters can't be remapped either, i.e. when typing in the developer command-prompt the letters which show are are those clicked on the keyboard (or those the computer thinks were clicked, keys can still be remapped on a sytem-wide level). The same applies to the : key to open the commandprompt, it is read as a literal letter
