//This is a texture wrapper class, which allows our graphical program to easilly interface with SDL textures, this class encodes both text and textures, as they behind the scene are the same (only the one is loaded from image files, the other is generated from text) SHOULD ONLY BE USED BY IO::GRAPHICS, NOONE ELSE SHOULD USE IT
